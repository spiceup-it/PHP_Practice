PHP User Defined Functions
Besides the built-in PHP functions, we can create our own functions.

A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.

A function will not execute immediately when a page loads.

A function will be executed by a call to the function.


Create a User Defined Function in PHP
A user-defined function declaration starts with the word function:

Syntax
function functionName() {
    code to be executed;
}

Function names are NOT case-sensitive.
    code to be executed;
